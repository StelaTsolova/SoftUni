The Java OOP course will teach you the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), work with classes and objects, use object-oriented modeling, 
and build hierarchies of classes. The basic principles of the OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and 
polymorphism will be studied. We will enter the most commonly used design patterns. 
We will pay attention to composite testing (unit testing) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD), the use of reflection.
