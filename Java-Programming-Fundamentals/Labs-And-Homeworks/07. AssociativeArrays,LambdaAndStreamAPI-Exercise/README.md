# 1.	Count Chars in a String

Write a program, which **counts all characters** in a string **except space (' ')**.

**Print all occurrences in the following format:**

**{char} -> {occurrences}**

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- |
| text | t -> 2 |
|      | e -> 1 |
|      | x -> 1 |
| **Input** | **Output** |

# 2.	A Miner Task

Until you receive **"stop"** command, you will be given a sequence of strings, each on a new line. Every **odd** line on the console is representing 
a **resource** (e.g. Gold, Silver, Copper, etc.) and every **even** - **quantity**. Your task is to collect the resources and print them each on a new line.

**Print the resources and their quantities in format: {resource} -> {quantity}**

The quantities inputs will be in the range **[1 ... 2 000 000 000]**

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | | **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gold   | Gold -> 155  | | gold   | gold -> 170  |
| 155    | Silver -> 10 | | 155    | silver -> 10 |
| Silver | Copper -> 17 | | silver | copper -> 17 |
| 10     |              | | 10     |
| Copper |              | | copper |
| 17     |              | | 17     |
| stop   |              | | gold   |
|        |              | | 15     |
|        |              | | stop   |

# 3.	Legendary Farming

*You've beaten all the content and the last thing left to accomplish is own a legendary item. However, it's a tedious process and requires quite a bit of farming.*

Anyway, you are not too pretentious - any legendary will do. The possible items are:

- **Shadowmourne** - requires **250 Shards**
- **Valanyr** - requires **250 Fragments**
- **Dragonwrath** - requires **250 Motes**

**Shards, Fragments** and **Motes** are the **key materials**, all else is **junk.** You will be given lines of input, such as\
**"2 motes 3 ores 15 stones".** Keep track of the **key materials -** the **first** that reaches the **250 mark** **wins** the **race**. At that point, 
print the corresponding legendary obtained. Then, print the **remaining** shards, fragments, motes, ordered by **quantity** in **descending** order, 
then by **name** in **ascending** order, each on a new line. Finally, print the collected **junk** items, in **alphabetical** order.

### Input

- Each line of input is in format **{quantity} {material} {quantity} {material} ... {quantity} {material}**

### Output

- On the first line, print the obtained item in format **{Legendary item} obtained!**
- On the next three lines, print the remaining key materials in descending order by quantity

   o If two key materials have the same quantity, print them in alphabetical order
- On the final several lines, print the junk items in alphabetical order

   o All materials are printed in format **{material}: {quantity}**
   
   o All output should be **lowercase**, except the first letter of the legendary

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- | 
| 3 Motes 5 stones 5 Shards         | Valanyr obtained! |
| 6 leathers 255 fragments 7 Shards | fragments: 5      |
|                                   | shards: 5         |
|                                   | motes: 3          |
|                                   | leathers: 6       |
|                                   | stones: 5         |
| **Input** | **Output** | 
| 123 silver 6 shards 8 shards 5 motes | Dragonwrath obtained! |
|  9 fangs 75 motes 103 MOTES 8 Shards | shards: 22            |
|  86 Motes 7 stones 19 silver         | motes: 19             |
|                                      | fragments: 0          |
|                                      | fangs: 9              |
|                                      | silver: 123           |

# 4.	Orders

Write a program, which keeps information about **products** and their **prices**. Each product has a **name**, a **price** and its **quantity**. 
If the product **doesn't exist** yet, **add** it with its **starting quantity**.

If you receive a product, which **already exists,** **increase** its quantity by the input quantity and if its **price is different**, **replace** the price as well.

You will receive products' **names**, **prices** and **quantities** on **new lines**.Until you receive the command "**buy**", keep adding items. 
When you do receive the command "**buy**", print the items with their **names** and **total price** of all the products with that name.

### Input

-   Until you receive "**buy**", the products come in the format: "**{name} {price} {quantity}**"
-   The product data is **always** delimited by a **single space**

### Output

-   Print information about **each** **product**, following the format:\
    "**{productName} -> {totalPrice}**"
- **Format** the average grade to the **2^nd^ decimal place**

# 5.	SoftUni Parking

*SoftUni just got a new **parking lot**. It's so fancy, it even has online **parking validation**. Except, the online service doesn't work. It can only receive users' data, 
but doesn't know what to do with it. Good thing you're on the dev team and know how to fix it, right?*

Write a program, which validates parking for an online service. Users can **register** to park and **unregister** to leave.

The program **receives 2 commands**:

- "register {username} {licensePlateNumber}":
   
   o The system only supports **one car per user** at the moment, so if a user tries to register **another license plate**, using the **same username**, 
the system should print:\
"ERROR: already registered with plate number {licensePlateNumber}"

   o If the aforementioned checks pass successfully, the plate can be registered, so the\
system should print:\
Â "**{username} registered {licensePlateNumber} successfully**"

- "unregister {username}":
   
   o If the user is **not present** in the database, the system should print:\
"ERROR: user {username} not found"

   o If the aforementioned check passes successfully, the system should print:\
"{username} unregistered successfully"

After you execute all of the commands, **print** all the currently **registered users** and their **license plates** in the format:

-   "**{username} => {licensePlateNumber}**"

### Input

- First line: **n** - **number of commands** - **integer**
- Next **n** lines: **commands** in one of **two** possible formats:

   o Register: "register {username} {licensePlateNumber}"

   o Unregister: "unregister {username}"

The input will **always** be **valid** and you **do not need** to check it explicitly.

# 9.	*ForceBook

You should store information for every **unique forceUser**, registered in the application.

You will receive **several input lines** in one of the following formats:

**{forceSide} | {forceUser}**
**{forceUser} -> {forceSide}**

The forceUser and forceSide are strings, containing **any** character.

If you receive **forceSide** **| forceUser** you should **check if such forceUser already exists**, and **if not** - **add** him/her to the corresponding side.

If you receive a **forceUser -> forceSide** you should check if there is such **forceUser** already and if so, **change his/her side**. If there is no such **forceUser**, 
add him/her to the corresponding **forceSide**, treating the command **as new registered forceUser.**\
**Then you should print on the console: "{forceUser} joins the {forceSide} side!"**

You should end your program when you receive the command **"Lumpawaroo"**. At that point you should print each force side, **ordered descending by forceUsers count, 
than ordered by name**. For each side print the **forceUsers**, **ordered by name**.

In case there are **no forceUsers in a side**, you **shouldn't print** the side information.

### Input / Constraints

- The input comes in the form of commands in one of the formats specified above
- The input ends when you receive the command **"Lumpawaroo"**

### Output

- As output for each forceSide, **ordered descending by forceUsers count**, **then by name**, you must print all the forceUsers, **ordered by name alphabetically**
- The output format is:

**Side: {forceSide}, Members: {forceUsers.Count}**
**! {forceUser}**
**! {forceUser}**
**! {forceUser}**

- In case there are **NO** forceUsers, don't print this side

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- |
| Light | George | Side: Dark, Members: 1  |
| Dark | Peter   | ! Peter                 |
