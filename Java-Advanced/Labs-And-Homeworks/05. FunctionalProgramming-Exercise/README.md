# 1.	Consumer Print

Write a program that **reads** a collection of **strings**, separated by one or **more** whitespaces, from the console and then prints them onto the console. 
Each string should be printed on a new line. Use a **Consumer<T\>**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- |
| Peter George Alex | Peter  |
|                   | George |
|                   | Alex   |
| **Input** | **Output** |
| John Sam Sara | John |
|               | Sam  |
|               | Sara |

# 2.	Knights of Honor

Write a program that **reads a collection of names** as strings from the console and then **appends "Sir"** in front of every name and prints it back onto the console. 
Use a **Consumer<T\>**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- |
| Peter George Alex Stan | Sir Peter  |
|                        | Sir George | 
|                        | Sir Alex   |
|                        | Sir Stan   |
| **Input** | **Output** |
| Alex George Peter | Sir Alex   |
|                   | Sir George |
|                   | Sir Peter  |

# 3.	Custom Min Function

Write a simple program that **reads** a **set of numbers** from the console and finds the **smallest** of the **numbers** using a simple **Function<Integer[], Integer>**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- |
| 1 4 3 2 1 7 13 | 1 |
| **Input** | **Output** | 
| 4 5 -2 3 -5 8 | -5 |

# 4.	Applied Arithmetic

On the first line you are given a **list of numbers**. On the next lines you are passed different **commands** that you need to apply to all numbers in the list: 
**"add"** -> adds 1; **"multiply"** -> multiplies by 2; **"subtract"** -> subtracts 1; **"print"** -> prints all numbers on **a new line**. 
The input will end with an "**end**" command, after which you need to print the result.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | | **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 2 3 4 5 | 3 4 5 6 7 | | 5 10     | 9 19 |
| add       |           | | multiply |
| add       |           | | subtract |
| print     |           | | print    |
| end       |           | | end      |

# 5.	Reverse and Exclude

Write a program that **reverses** a collection and **removes** elements that are **divisible** by a given integer **n**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- |
| 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 5 3 1 |
| 2           |
| **Input** | **Output** | 
| 20 10 40 30 60 50 | 50 40 10 20 |
| 3                 |

# 6.	Predicate for Names

Write a **predicate**. Its goal is to **check** a name for its length and to return **true** if the names length is **less or equal** the passed **integer**. 
You will be given an **integer** that represents the length you have to use. On the second line you will be given a **string** array with some names. 
Print the names, passing the **condition** in the predicate.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4                         | Sara | | 4            | Zara |
| Sara Sam George Mark John | Sam  | | George Peter | Sara |
|                           | Mark | | Zara Sara    |
|                           | John | |              |

# 7.	Find the Smallest Element

Write a program which is usingÂ  a custom **function** (written by you) to find the **smallest** integer in a **sequence** of **integers**. The input could have more than 
one space. Your task is to **collect** the integers from the console, find the **smallest one** and print its **index** (if **more** than one such elements exist, 
print the index of the **rightmost** one).

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- |
| 1 2 3 0 4 5 6 | 3 |
| **Input** | **Output** |
| 123 10 11 3 | 3 |

# 8.	Custom Comparator

Write a custom **comparator** that **sorts** all even numbers before all **odd** ones in **ascending order**. Pass it to an **Arrays.sort()** function and print the result.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- |
| 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 2 4 6 1 3 5 |
| **Input** | **Output** | 
| -3 2 | 2 -3 |

# 9.	List of Predicates

Find all **numbers** in the range **1..N** that are **divisible** by the numbers of a given sequence. Use **predicates**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- |
| 10      | 2 4 6 8 10 |
| 1 1 1 2 |
| **Input** | **Output** | 
| 100       | 20 40 60 80 100 |
| 2 5 10 20 |

# 10.	Predicate Party!

The Wire's parents are on a vacation for the holidays and he is planning an epic party at home. Unfortunately, 
his organizational skills are next to non-existent so you are given the task to help him with the reservations.

On the first line you get a **list** with all the **people** that are coming. On the next lines, until you get the "**Party**!" command, 
you may be asked to **double** or **remove** all the people that apply to **given criteria**. There are three different options:

- Everyone that has a name **starting** with a given string.
- Everyone that has a name **ending** with a given string.
- Everyone that has a name with a given **length**.

When you print the guests that are coming to the party, you have to print them in **asscending** order. If nobody is going, print **"Nobody is going to the party!".** 
See the examples below:

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- |
| Peter Misha Stephan | Misha, Misha, Stephan are going to the party! |
| Remove StartsWith P |
| Double Length 5     |
| Party!              |
| **Input** | **Output** | 
| Peter                  | Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter are going to the party! |
| Double StartsWith Pete |
| Double EndsWith eter   |
| Party!                 |
| **Input** | **Output** | 
| Peter               | Nobody is going to the party! |
| Remove StartsWith P |
| Party!              |

# 11.	* The Party Reservation Filter Module

You are a young and talented **developer**. The first task you need to do is to implement a **filtering module** to a party reservation software. 
First, The Party Reservation Filter Module (**TPRF** Module for short) is passed a **list** with invitations. Next the **TPRF** receives a sequence of 
**commands** that specify if you need to add or remove a given filter.

**TPRF** Commands are in the given format **{command;filter type;filter parameter}**

You can receive the following **TPRF** commands: **"Add filter"**, **"Remove filter"** or **"Print"**. The possible **TPRF** filter types are: 
**"Starts with", "Ends with", "Length"** and **"Contains".** All **TPRF** filter parameters will be a string (or an integer for the length filter).

The input will end with a **"Print"** command. See the examples below:

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | | **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Peter Misha Slav         | Slav | | Peter Misha John            | Misha John |
| Add filter;Starts with;P |      | | Add filter;Starts with;P    |
| Add filter;Starts with;M |      | | Add filter;Starts with;M    |
| Print                    |      | | Remove filter;Starts with;M |
|                          |      | | Print                       |
