# 2.	Company Roster

Define a class **Employee** that holds the following information: **name, salary, position, department, email** and **age**. The **name, salary, position** and 
**department** are **mandatory** while the rest are **optional**.

Your task is to write a program which takes **N** lines of information about employees from the console and calculates the department with the highest average salary and 
prints for each employee in that department his **name, salary, email and age** - **sorted by salary in descending order**. 
If an employee **doesn't have** an **email** - in place of that field you should print **"n/a"** instead, if he doesn't have an **age** - print **"-1"** instead. 
The **salary** should be printed to **two decimal places** after the seperator.

# 3.	* Speed Racing

Your task is to implement a program that keeps track of cars and their fuel and supports methods for moving the cars. Define a class **Car** that keeps track of 
a car information **Model, fuel amount, fuel cost for 1 kilometer** and **distance traveled**. A Car Model is **unique** - there will never be 2 cars with the same model.

Â On the first line of the input you will receive a number **N** - the number of cars you need to track, on **each** of the next **N** lines you will receive information for 
 a car in the following format "**{Model} {FuelAmount} {FuelCostFor1km}**", all **cars start at 0 kilometers traveled**.\
After the **N** lines until the command "**End**" is received, you will receive commands in the following format "**Drive {CarModel} {amountOfKm}**", implement a method in 
the **Car** class to calculate whether a car **can** move that distance or **not**. If it yes, the car **fuel amount** should be **reduced** by the amount of used fuel and 
its **distance traveled** should be increased by the amount of kilometers traveled, otherwise the car should not move (Its fuel amount and distance traveled should stay 
the same) and you should print on the console "**Insufficient fuel for the drive**". After the "**End**" command is received, print each car in order of appearing in input and 
its current fuel amount and distance traveled in the format "**{Model} {fuelAmount} {distanceTraveled}**", where the fuel amount should be printed to **two decimal places** 
after the separator.

# 4.	 Raw Data

You are the owner of a courier company and you want to make a system for tracking your cars and their cargo. Define a class **Car** that holds information about 
**model, engine, cargo** and a **collection of exactly 4 tires**. The engine, cargo and tire **should be separate classes**, create a constructor that receives all 
information about the Car and creates and initializes its inner components (engine, cargo and tires).

On the first line of the input you will receive a number **N** - the number of cars you have, on each of the next **N** lines you will receive information about a car in the format:

"**{Model} {EngineSpeed} {EnginePower} {CargoWeight} {CargoType} {Tire1Pressure} {Tire1Age} {Tire2Pressure} {Tire2Age} {Tire3Pressure} {Tire]'3Age} {Tire4Pressure} {Tire4Age}"**, 
where the speed, power, weight and tire age are **integers**, tire pressure is a **double.**

After the **N** lines you will receive a single line with one of 2 commands "**fragile**" or "**flamable**", if the command is "**fragile**" print all 
cars whose **Cargo Type is "fragile**" with a **tire** whose **pressure is < 1**, if the command is "**flamable**" print all cars whose **Cargo Type is "flamable**" and 
have **Engine Power > 250**. The cars should be printed in order of appearing in the input.

# 5.	Car Salesman

cDefine two classes **Car** and **Engine.** A **Car** has a **model, engine, weight** and **color**. An Engine has **model**, **power, displacement** and **efficiency**. 
A Car's **weight**, color, its Engine's displacements, and **efficiency** are **optional**.

On the first line, you will read a number **N** which will specify how many lines of engines you will receive, on each of the next **N** lines you will receive information about
an **Engine** in the following format "**{Model} {Power} {Displacement} {Efficiency}**". After the lines with engines, 
on the next line you will receive a number **M** - specifying the number of Cars that will follow, on each of the next **M** lines the information about 
a **Car** will follow in the following format "**{Model} {Engine} {Weight} {Color}**", where the engine in the format will be the **model of an existing** **Engine**. 
When creating the object for a **Car**, you should keep a **reference to the real engine** in it, instead of just the engines model, **note** that 
the optional properties **might be missing** from the formats.

Your task is to print each car (in the **order** you **received** them) and its information in the format-defined bellow. 
If any of the optional fields has not been given print "**n/a**" in its place instead of:

**{CarModel}:**\
**{EngineModel}:**\
**Power: {EnginePower}**\
**Displacement: {EngineDisplacement}**\
**Efficiency: {EngineEfficiency}**\
**Weight: {CarWeight}**\
**Color: {CarColor}**

# 6.	PokÃ©mon Trainer

You wanna be the very best pokemon trainer, like no one ever was, so you set out to catch pokemons. Define a class **Trainer** and a class **Pokemon**. Trainer has a **name**, 
**number of badges** and a **collection of pokemon**. Pokemon has a **name**, an **element** and **health**, all values are **mandatory**. Every Trainer **starts with 0 badges**.

From the console you will receive an unknown number of lines until you receive the command "**Tournament**", each line will carry information about a pokemon and 
the trainer who caught it in the format "**{TrainerName} {PokemonName} {PokemonElement} {PokemonHealth}**"where **TrainerName** is the name of the Trainer who caught 
the pokemon, names are **unique** there cannot be 2 trainers with the same name. After receiving the command "**Tournament**" an unknown number of lines containing one of 
three elements "**Fire**", "**Water**", "**Electricity**" will follow until the command "**End**" is received. For every command you must check if a trainer has 
**at least 1** pokemon with the given element, if he does he receives 1 badge, otherwise all his pokemon **lose 10 health**, 
if a pokemon falls **to 0 or less health he dies** and must be deleted from the trainer's collection. After the command "**End**" is received you should print all 
trainers **sorted by the amount of badges they have in descending order** (if two trainers have the same amount of badges they should be sorted by order of appearance in
the input)in the format "**{TrainerName} {Badges} {NumberOfPokemon}**".

# 7.	Google

*Google is always watching you, so it should come as no surprise that they know everything about you (even your pokemon collection), since you're a really good at writing 
classes, Google asked you to design a Class that can hold all the information they need for people.*

You will receive an unknown number of rows from the console until you receive the "**End**" command, 
on each of those lines there will be information about a person in one of the following formats:

- "**{Name} company {companyName} {department} {salary}**"Â 
- "**{Name} pokemon {pokemonName} {pokemonType}**"
- "**{Name} parents {parentName} {parentBirthday}**"
- "**{Name} children {childName} {childBirthday}**"
- "**{Name} car {carModel} {carSpeed}**"

You should structure all information about a person in a class with nested subclasses. People names are **unique** - there won't be 2 people with the same name, 
a person can also have **only 1 company** and **car**, but can have **multiple parents, children** and **pokemons**. After the command "**End**" is 
received on the next line you will receive a **single** name, you should **print** all information about that person. **Note** that information can change **during** 
the **input**, for instance if we receive multiple lines which specify a person company, only the **last one** should be the one remembered. The salary must be formated to 
**two decimal places** after the seperator.

**Note**: print the information in format:

 **{personName}**

 **Company:**

 **{companyName} {companyDepartment} {salary}**

Â **...**

 **Children**:

**{childName} {childBirthday}**

 **{childName} {childBirthday}**
