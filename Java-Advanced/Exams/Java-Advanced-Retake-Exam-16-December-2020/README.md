# 1. Cooking

*You are asked to cook baked foods for the near bakery, because your recipes are so great. You need to mix liquids with ingredients to cook the required delicacies.*

First, you will be given **a sequence of integers, representing liquids**. Afterwards, you will be given another **sequence of integers representing ingredients**.

You need to start from the **first liquid** and try to mix it with the **last ingredient.** If the **sum** of their values is **equal** to 
**any of the items in the table below** - **cook the food corresponding** to the **value** and **remove** **both** the **liquid** and the **ingredient**. 
Otherwise, **remove only the liquid** and **increase** the **value** of the **ingredient by 3**. You need to **stop** combining when you have **no more liquids** or **ingredients**

| **Food** | **Value needed** |
| --- | --- |
| Bread     | 25  |
| Cake      | 50  |
| Pastry    | 75  |
| Fruit Pie	| 100 |

### Input

- On the **first line**, you will receive the integers representing the **liquids**, **separated** by a **single space**.
- On the **second line**, you will receive the integers representing the **ingredients**, **separated** by a **single space**.

### Output

- On the **first** line of output print one of the following ouputs:

  o "**Wohoo! You succeeded in cooking all the food!**" -if you have at least

  **one of each** of the **foods**, after completing combining.

  o "**Ugh, what a pity! You didn't have enough materials to cook everything.**" - if you **did not** collect  **one of each** of the **foods**, after completing combining.

- On the **second** line - print all liquids you have left:

  o If there are no liquids: "**Liquids left: none**"

  o If there are liquids: "**Liquids left: {liquid1}, {liquid2}, {liquid3}, (...)**"

- On the **third** line - print all physical materials you have left:

  o If there are no items: "**Ingredients** **left: none**"
 
  o If there are items: "**Ingredients left: {ingredient}, {ingredient}, {ingredient}, (...)"**

- Then, you need to print **all** AdvancedMaterials and the **amount you have of them**, ordered **alphabetically**:

  o **"Bread: {amount}"**

  o **"Cake: {amount}"**

  o **"Fruit Pie: {amount}"**

  o **"Pastry: {amount}"**

### Constraints

- All of the given numbers will be valid integers in the range **[0, 100]**.
- Advanced materials **can be** crafted more than once.

### Examples

# 2. Selling

*You successfully started your cooking journey, so now you need to sell the products from your basketÂ  in the bakery in order to collect your price.*

You will be given an integer **n** for the **size** of the bakery with **square** shape. On the next **n** lines, you will receive the **rows** of the bakery. 
You will be placed on a **random position**, marked with the letter '**S**'. On random positions there will be clients, marked with a **single digit**. 
There **may** also be **pillars**. Their **count** will be either **0** or **2** and they are **marked** with the **letter** - '**O**'. 
**All of the empty positions** will bemarked with **'-'**.

Each turn, you will be given **commands** for the **your movement**. Move commands will be: "**up**", "**down**", "**left**", "**right**". If you **move** to a **client**, 
you **collects the price equal** to the **digit there** and the client **disappears**. If you move to a **pillar**, you move on the **position** of the **other pillar** and 
then **both** pillars **disappear**. If you **go out** of the bakery, you **disappear** from the bakery and you are out of there. 
You need **at least 50 dollars** to rent your own Bakery

When **you are out of the bakery or you collect enough money**, the program **ends**.

### Input

- On the first line, you are given the integer **n** - the size of the **square** matrix.
- The **next n lines** holds the values for every **row**.
- On each of the next lines you will get a move command.

### Output

- On the first line:

  o If the player goes to the void, print: "**Bad news, you are out of the bakery.**"

  o If the player collects enough star power, print: "**Good news! You succeeded in collecting enough money!**"

- On the second line print all star power collected: "**Money: {money}**"
- In the end print the matrix.

### Constraints

- The size of the **square** matrix will be between **[2...10].**
- There will **always** be **0** or **2** pillars, marked with the **letter** - '**O**'.
- Your position will be marked with '**S**'.
- You will **always** go out of the bakery or collect enough money.

# 3. Openning

### Problem description

Your task is to create a bakery, which stores employees by creating the classes described below.

First, write a Java class **Employee** with the following properties:

- **name: String**
- **age: int**
- **country: String**

The class **constructor** should receive **name**, **age** and **country** and override the **ToString()** method in the following format:

**"Employee: {name}, {age} ({country})"**

**Next**, write a Java class **Bakery** that has **employees** (a collection, which stores the entity **Employee**). 
All entities inside the repository have the **same properties**. Also, the Bakery class should have those properties:

- **name: String**
- **capacity: int**

The class **constructor** should receive **name** and **capacity**, also it should initialize the **employees** with a new instance of the collection.
Implement the following features:

- Field **employees** - **List** that holds added Employees
- Method add(Employee employee) - **adds** an **entity** to the data **if there is room** for him/her.
- Method remove(String name) - removes an employee by **given name,** if such **exists**, and **returns bool**.
- Method getOldestEmployee() - returns the **oldest** employee.
- Method **getEmployee(string name)** - returns the employee with the **given name**.
- Getter getCount() - **returns** the **number** of employees.
- **report()** - **returns** a **string** in the following **format**:
- 
  o **"Employees working at Bakery {bakeryName}:**\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **{Employee1}**\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **{Employee2}**\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **(...)**"

### Constraints

- The **names** of the employees will be **always unique**.
- The **age** of the employees will always be with **positive values**.
- You will always have an employee added before receiving methods manipulating the Space Station's Employees.

### Examples

This is an example how the **Bakery** class is **intended to be used**.
