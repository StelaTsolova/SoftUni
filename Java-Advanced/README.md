The Java Advanced course looks at working with the Java language. In the course you will learn to create linear structures of data, 
solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with streams, files and directories, create template classes. Attention is paid to the paradigm functional programming, 
as well as the main tool betting on it - Stream API for processing data flows. The development environment to be used by the train team is IntelliJ Idea 2020, 
but each student is free to use tools by preference.
