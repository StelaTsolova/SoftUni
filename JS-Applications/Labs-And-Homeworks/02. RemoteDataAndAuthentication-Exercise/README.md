# 1. Messenger

Write a JS program that records and displays messages. The user can post a message, supplying a name and content and retrieve all currently recorded messages.

**The url** for the requests - **http://localhost:3030/jsonstore/messenger**

When \[**Send**] **button** is clicked you should create a **new object** and send a **post request** to the given url. Use the following message structure:

**{**\
&nbsp;&nbsp; **author: authorName,**\
&nbsp;&nbsp; **content: msgText,**\
**}**

If you click over \[**Refresh**] **button** you should **get all** messages with **GET request** and display them into the textarea. Use the following message format:

"**{author}: {message}**"

# 2.	Phonebook

Write a JS program that can load, create and delete entries from a Phonebook. You will be given an HTML template to which you must bind the needed functionality.

When the **\[Load]** button is clicked, a **GET** request should be made to the server to get all phonebook entries.EachÂ  received entry should be in a **li** inside 
the **ul** with **id="phonebook"** in the following format with text **"\<person>: \<phone>"** and a **\[Delete]** button attached. 
Pressing the **\[Delete]** button should send a **DELETE** request to the server and delete the entry. 
The received response will be an object in the following format:\
**{\<key>:{person:\<person>, phone:\<phone>}, \<key2>:{person:\<person2>, phone:\<phone2>,...}** where **\<key>** is an unique key given by the server and 
**\<person>** and **\<phone>** are the actual values.

When the **\[Create]** button is clicked, a new **POST** request should be made to the server with the information from the Person and Phone textboxes, 
the Person and Phone textboxes should be cleared and the Phonebook should be automatically reloaded (like if the **\[Load]** button was pressed).

The data sent on a POST request should be a valid JSON object, containing properties person and phone. Example format:\
**{**\
&nbsp;&nbsp; **"person": "\<person>",**\
&nbsp;&nbsp; **"phone": "\<phone>"**\
**}**

The **url** to which your program should make requests is:

**http://localhost:3030/jsonstore/phonebook**

**GET** and **POST** requests should go to **http://localhost:3030/jsonstore/phonebook**, while **DELETE** requests should go to 
**http://localhost:3030/jsonstore/phonebook/:key>** , where **:key** is the unique **key** of the entry (you can find out the key from the key property in the **GET** request)
